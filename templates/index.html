    <p>
       Do you like Cheese Whiz? Spray tan? Fake eyelashes? That's what is Lorem Ipsum to 
      manyâ€”it rubs them the wrong way, all the way. It's unreal, uncanny, makes you 
     wonder if something is wrong, it seems to seek your attention for all the wrong 
     reasons. Usually, we prefer the real thing, wine without sulfur based preservatives, 
      real butter, not margarine, and so we'd like our layouts and designs to be filled 
     with real words, with thoughts that count, information that has value.
